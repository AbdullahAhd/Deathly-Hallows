  <h1>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Book Review</h1>
  
  <p>Hey, everyone! Abdullah here, and today, I’m going to be discussing the novel Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows by JK Rowling! 
</p>

<p>In the story, Harry Potter quits going to Hogwarts due to the reappearance of the main villain: Lord Voldemort. His main goal is to kill all horcruxes (pieces of Voldemort's soul), so that he could face off with him and end his reign once and for all. After he and his friends defeat all the horcruxes, and have to deal with the deaths and sacrifices of their loved ones as their journey progresses. Everything pays off with Harry’s final face off with Voldemort ending in a success for his side. Harry and his allies' mental pain from the numerous deaths of those around them and the possibility of his own demise facing off Voldemort. If he doesn’t beat Voldemort, then the rest of the world would have to pay the price. The several deaths that happened in front of his eyes throughout his life recharges him to keep moving forward and succeed, so those who died for him would get their reward. There’s this great moment in the story, where Bill Weasley mentions "Dealings between wizards and goblins have been fraught for centuries”(Rowling 356), then once Harry asks a goblin named griphook for help in breaking into a Gringotts vault he tell him that he’s “decided to help…[For] the sword of Godric Gryffindor”(Rowling 378), but later betrays them by leaving them to die in the vault seeing “that the goblin had never expected them to keep their word”(Rowling 382). I feel that the message is conveyed so well in that moment because it foreshadows betrayal of those who don’t put trust in those around them, even when it’s their last effort for freedom in a dark world. 
</p>

<p>I believe that, in this story, the author’s purpose is to persuade young people in a stressful point in their lives to keep moving forward and instead of wasting energy on grieving the possibilities of a failure. At the battle of Hogwarts, Harry becomes unconscious and it is believed that he’s dead, but the one person on the good side (Neville Longbottom) doesn’t lose hope, and mentions that people die everyday and his death is just another one of them. Rowling is effective in persuading their audience because she kept the Point of View on Harry’s despair and shifted over to the morals gradually. 
</p>

<p>So, is it worth the read? Well, I think that it is. It’s both entertaining and morally thriving. </p>

<p>Now, I know what you’re thinking: The story displays morals slowly, meaning that morals wouldn’t immediately be known by the reader. To that I say yes, but that's what makes a good book, it all makes sense once you’ve read it all.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, and be sure to check out Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows by JK Rowling.
